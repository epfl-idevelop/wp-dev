  WordPress @ EPFL: the development environment
</h1>

In this repository you will find:

- Support for running the VPSI WordPress stack locally

# Install and Usage

## Initial Setup

1. Edit your `/etc/hosts` or platform equivalent and set up a line like this:  
   `127.0.0.1       wp-httpd`
1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-dev)
1. Type `make checkout` to download and setup all the required codebases
1. Inspect subdirectories `wp-ops` and `volumes/wp/jahia2wp` and make
   sure they are on the branches you wish to develop from.
   - As of Q4 2019, the ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù platform (the one being used in
     production) is with `wp-ops` on `master` and `volumes/wp/jahia2wp`
     on `release2018`
1. Type `make` to bring up the development stack, then `make exec` to enter the
   so-called management container
1. Within the management container, type  
```
cd /srv/${WP_ENV}/
mkdir -p wp-httpd/htdocs
cd wp-httpd/htdocs
```  
1. Create one or more sites under `/srv/${WP_ENV}/wp-httpd/htdocs` using either
   the `wp` command-line tool (for a ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù WordPress site) or
   `jahia2wp create`. Check the [new-wp-site.sh](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-ops/blob/feature/script-to-create-a-site/docker/mgmt/new-wp-site.sh) command, it should work without any of the
   ansible or jahia2wp jam.

### wp-gutenberg-epfl activation

Once you have at least one site up and running, you can convert it to WordPress 5 by typing

```
make wp5 SITE_DIR=/srv/test/wp-httpd/htdocs/vpsi-next
```

## Day-To-Day Operations

1. Type `make checkout up`
1. Hack on things
1. Additional helpful commands are: `make exec`, `make httpd` and more (try
   `make help` for an overview)

### Apache Access and Error Logs

To follow the Apache access and error logs, type (respectively)
```
make tail-access
make tail-errors
```

### Debugger

Once the Docker containers are up and running, type
`./devscripts/php-xdebug start` to turn on debugging using
[Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting).

(When you are done with debugging, type `./devscripts/php-xdebug stop`)

Your debugger or IDE must be listening for incoming Xdebug connections
on port 9000, and your workstation / laptop must have a non-localhost
IPv4 address set up; if this is not the case, the script will attempt
to set up a fake one for you (for debugging while riding the bus ‚Äî
Supported platforms only).

‚ö† The first run of `./devscripts/php-xdebug start` needs to download
and install some support software into the `wp-httpd` docker image, so
using a fake IP address is probably not going to work the first time
around (although it should for the subsequent ones, until you restart
the `wp-httpd` container).

[Additional instructions to configure PHPStorm / IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-xdebug.html)

üí° The next piece of trouble when remote debugging is path mapping,
which is not covered here. If your IDE breakpoints don't quite work,
consider inserting the following line in an appropriate place in your
PHP code:<pre>xdebug_break();</pre>

### Indexation (ctags / etags)

If you are a ctags / etags user, type `make tags` resp. `make TAGS` to
index the checked out sources (including the core of WordPress and the
third-party plugins).

### Acceptance tests

To run the acceptance tests in their developer-friendly ("unpacked")
incarnationagainst the local development environment, using a browser
that is re-used across test runs, do<pre>
cd docker/acceptance
npm i
./bin/run-chrome
</pre>

and follow the instructions that appear on-screen.

To build and run the same in the "canned" version (the one that runs
within the Jenkins pipeline) try<pre>
cd docker/acceptance
npm run docker --  --screenshot-always
</pre>

### Database Access

The development environment provides a
[PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) instance on
http://localhost:8080/ . The database host is "db"; the user and
password are in the `.env` file, as the values of the
`MYSQL_SUPER_USER` and `MYSQL_SUPER_PASSWORD` variables, respectively.

As far as command-line access is concerned, you can access a superuser
MySQL prompt by typing
```
docker exec -it wp-local_db_1 bash -c 'mysql -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD'
```

and you can activate and follow the generate query log with
```
make tail-sql
```

### Backup / Restore

`make backup` will create a `wordpress-state.tgz` containing all the
files under `volumes/srv`, plus a database dump in SQL format.

`make restore` performs the opposite operation.

# Technical Documentation

## `docker-compose.yml`

Unlike production (which uses Kubernetes / OpenShift), the bunch is
tied together using the `docker-compose.yml` file on the developer's
workstation. Some containers (e.g. `phpmyadmin`) only run in
development mode; others (e.g. `httpd`) have additional Docker volumes
mounted, so as to "reach into" them from the developer's IDE or code
editor.

## `.env` file

The `.env` file contains environment variable declarations, some
specific to the development rig (e.g. `WP_PORT_PHPMA` for the
PHPMyAdmin port that Docker exposes), some identical to production
(`MYSQL_*`, `WP_VERSION`, `WP_ADMIN_*` and `WP_ENV`).

## Volumes

### `volumes/db`

The MySQL persistent database directory, used by the `mysql` container

### `volumes/srv` (mounted as `/srv`)

The serving directory tree, comprised of any number of WordPress
instances and/or other Apache-servable assets (e.g. directories
containing just a `.htaccess` file). The purpose and layout are
identical to the `/srv` directory in production (which is hosted on a
NAS); in particular, the subdirectory structure is the same:

| Path fragment | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/srv/` | The root of the serving directory |
| `${WP_ENV}/` | The so-called *environment* mimicking the top-level NAS subdirectories in production (one per serving replicated `httpd` pod in OpenShift) |
| `wp-httpd/` | The host name in termes of Apache's [`VirtualDocumentRoot` directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html#virtualdocumentroot). When running locally, the host name must match both the name of the `httpd` container in `devsupport/docker-compose.yml`, and a suitable entry in `/etc/hosts` so that one can navigate to the sites below this directory |
| `htdocs/` | Dictated by the `VirtualDocumentRoot` value |
| `sub/dir/` | Any path can go here, affording for a hierarchy of nested WordPress instances to be installed locally |
| `wp-config.php`<br/>`index.php`<br/>etc. | A typical WordPress installation |

### `volumes/wp` (mounted as `/wp`)

Contains a "live" copy of all the PHP code (WordPress + VPSI-authored,
standard-issue themes and plug-ins) - Unlike in production, where that
same `/wp` directory is baked into the Docker image. From any given
site under `/srv`, symlinks may (or may not) be used to alias the
WordPress code and plug-ins into the site.

The intent of this volume is to allow developers to edit the source
code of both the WordPress core, the "official" plug-ins and the
plug-ins and themes authored by EPFL staff. The latter are
additionally checked out as part of their original Git depots, so that
developers can push their changes back upstream - That includes the
[jahia2wp repository](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/jahia2wp),
which (for historical reasons) is a Python-based utility that contains
some WordPress plugins and mu-plugins.

You can audit the development rig by yourselves if you type
`find volumes/wp -type l -o -name .git`. Here is what you'll find:

| Path under `volumes/wp` | Implementation | Purpose |
|-------------------------|---------|----------------|
| `jahia2wp` | Git checkout from the [jahia2wp depot](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/jahia2wp) | Provides the targets for the `plugins` and `mu-plugins` symlinks below, both inside and outside the Docker containers |
| `wp-content/mu-plugins` | Symlink to `../../jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/mu-plugins` | The "must-use" plugins (we only use those from jahia2wp at the moment) |
|¬†`wp-content/plugins/epfl`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/epfl-404`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/EPFL-Content-Filter`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/epfl-404`<br/>etc. | Symlinks to the corresponding plug-ins in `../../jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/plugins` | These plug-ins are available for WordPress sites (in `/srv`) to symlink to; but unlike in production, they are symlinks themselves (so that when editing the files in there, one does so in the correct Git depot) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/plugins/accred` | Git checkout of [the Accred plug-in](https://github.com/epfl-sti/wordpress.plugin.accred/) | A (mostly) VPSI-authored WordPress plug-in, that lives in its own Git repository  |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/plugins/tequila` | Git checkout of [the Tequila plug-in](https://github.com/epfl-sti/wordpress.plugin.tequila/) | Ditto (at some point, we probably want to refactor the ones under jahia2wp in this way as well) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-theme-2018` | Git checkout of [`wp-theme-2018`](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-theme-2018/) | The modern WordPress theme, that implements [the 2018 style guide](https://epfl-idevelop.github.io/elements/#/) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-theme-2018` | Git checkout of [`wp-theme-2018`](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-theme-2018/) | The modern WordPress theme, that implements [the 2018 style guide](https://epfl-idevelop.github.io/elements/#/) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/epfl-blank`<br/>`volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/epfl-master` | Symlinks to jahia2wp (like the `EPFL-*` and `epfl*` plug-ins above) | So-called "2010-style" themes,  provided as part of the jahia2wp codebase for historical reasons. (These themes are obsolescent, as obviously further development focuses on `wp-theme-2018`) |
| `wp-content/index.php`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate`<br/> and more (basically all files except the ones mentioned above)  | Extracted from the Docker image by `make checkout` | These files or plug-ins are required by WordPress, and one can even edit them, but the development kit doesn't help with pushing the changes upstream. (In fact, doing `make checkout` again will revert the edits.)<br/> üí° <b>There might be some plug-ins (even VPSI-authored plugins) in that state</b> ‚Äî See below |

üí° Depending on which branch of jahia2wp is checked out, there might be some
plug-ins that exist in the Docker image, but not in
`volumes/wp/jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/plugins`. If you type `make checkout`
after changing branches in jahia2wp, the Makefile extracts the "orphan" plugins
from the image, but (obviously) doesn't symlink them back into jahia2wp. These
are not really source code ‚Äî That is, you could edit these files, but you won't
be able to push the changes upstream, and the next `make checkout` will revert
the changes.
