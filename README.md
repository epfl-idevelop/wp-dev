  WordPress @ EPFL: the development environment
</h1>

In this repository you will find:

- Support for running the VPSI WordPress stack locally

# Install and Usage

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository
1. Edit your `/etc/hosts` or platform equivalent and set up a line like this:<pre>127.0.0.1       wp-httpd</pre>
1. Type `make` to bring up the development stack, then `make exec` to enter the so-called management container
1. Within the management container, type<pre>
cd /srv/${WP_ENV}/
mkdir -p wp-httpd/htdocs
cd wp-httpd/htdocs
</pre>
1. Create one or more sites under `/srv/${WP_ENV}/wp-httpd/htdocs` using either the `wp` command-line tool (for a ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù WordPress site) or `jahia2wp create`
</pre>

## Day-To-Day Operations

1. Type `make checkout up`
1. Hack on things
1. Additional helpful commands are: `make exec`, `make httpd` and more (try `make help` for an overview)

### Acceptance tests

To build and run the "canned" version try<pre>
cd docker/acceptance
npm run docker --  --screenshot-always
</pre>

To run the "unpacked" version of same against the local development
environment, using a browser that is re-used across test runs, do<pre>
cd docker/acceptance npm i ./bin/run-chrome
</pre>

and follow the instructions that appear on-screen.



# Technical Documentation

## `docker-compose.yml`

Unlike production (which uses Kubernetes / OpenShift), the bunch is
tied together using the `docker-compose.yml` file on the developer's
workstation. Some containers (e.g. `phpmyadmin`) only run in
development mode; others (e.g. `httpd`) have additional Docker volumes
mounted, so as to "reach into" them from the developer's IDE or code
editor.

## `.env` file

The `.env` file contains environment variable declarations, some
specific to the development rig (e.g. `WP_PORT_PHPMA` for the
PHPMyAdmin port that Docker exposes), some identical to production
(`MYSQL_*`, `WP_VERSION`, `WP_ADMIN_*` and `WP_ENV`).

## Volumes

### `volumes/db`

The MySQL persistent database directory, used by the `mysql` container

### `volumes/srv` (mounted as `/srv`)

The serving directory tree, comprised of any number of WordPress
instances and/or other Apache-servable assets (e.g. directories
containing just a `.htaccess` file). The purpose and layout are
identical to the `/srv` directory in production (which is hosted on a
NAS); in particular, the subdirectory structure is the same:

| Path fragment | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/srv/` | The root of the serving directory |
| `${WP_ENV}/` | The so-called *environment* mimicking the top-level NAS subdirectories in production (one per serving replicated `httpd` pod in OpenShift) |
| `wp-httpd/` | The host name in termes of Apache's [`VirtualDocumentRoot` directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html#virtualdocumentroot). When running locally, the host name must match both the name of the `httpd` container in `devsupport/docker-compose.yml`, and a suitable entry in `/etc/hosts` so that one can navigate to the sites below this directory |
| `htdocs/` | Dictated by the `VirtualDocumentRoot` value |
| `sub/dir/` | Any path can go here, affording for a hierarchy of nested WordPress instances to be installed locally |
| `wp-config.php`<br/>`index.php`<br/>etc. | A typical WordPress installation |

### `volumes/wp` (mounted as `/wp`)

Contains a "live" copy of all the PHP code (WordPress + VPSI-authored,
standard-issue themes and plug-ins) - Unlike in production, where that
same `/wp` directory is baked into the Docker image. From any given
site under `/srv`, symlinks may (or may not) be used to alias the
WordPress code and plug-ins into the site.

The intent of this volume is to allow developers to edit the source
code of both the WordPress core, the "official" plug-ins and the
plug-ins and themes authored by EPFL staff. The latter are
additionally checked out as part of their original Git depots, so that
developers can push their changes back upstream - That includes the
[jahia2wp repository](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/jahia2wp),
which (for historical reasons) is a Python-based utility that contains
some WordPress plugins and mu-plugins.

You can audit the development rig by yourselves if you type `find volumes/wp -type l -o -name .git` . Here is what you'll find:

| Path under `volumes/wp` | Implementation | Purpose |
|-------------------------|---------|----------------|
| `jahia2wp` | Git checkout from the [jahia2wp depot](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/jahia2wp) | Provides the targets for the `plugins` and `mu-plugins` symlinks below, both inside and outside the Docker containers |
| `wp-content/mu-plugins` | Symlink to `../../jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/mu-plugins` | The "must-use" plugins (we only use those from jahia2wp at the moment) |
|¬†`wp-content/plugins/epfl`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/epfl-404`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/EPFL-Content-Filter`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/epfl-404`<br/>etc. | Symlinks to the corresponding plug-ins in `../../jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/plugins` | These plug-ins are available for WordPress sites (in `/srv`) to symlink to; but unlike in production, they are symlinks themselves (so that when editing the files in there, one does so in the correct Git depot) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/plugins/accred` | Git checkout of [the Accred plug-in](https://github.com/epfl-sti/wordpress.plugin.accred/) | A (mostly) VPSI-authored WordPress plug-in, that lives in its own Git repository  |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/plugins/tequila` | Git checkout of [the Tequila plug-in](https://github.com/epfl-sti/wordpress.plugin.tequila/) | Ditto (at some point, we probably want to refactor the ones under jahia2wp in this way as well) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-theme-2018` | Git checkout of [`wp-theme-2018`](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-theme-2018/) | The modern WordPress theme, that implements [the 2018 style guide](https://epfl-idevelop.github.io/elements/#/) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/wp-theme-2018` | Git checkout of [`wp-theme-2018`](https://github.com/epfl-idevelop/wp-theme-2018/) | The modern WordPress theme, that implements [the 2018 style guide](https://epfl-idevelop.github.io/elements/#/) |
| `volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/epfl-blank`<br/>`volumes/wp/wp-content/themes/epfl-master` | Symlinks to jahia2wp (like the `EPFL-*` and `epfl*` plug-ins above) | So-called "2010-style" themes,  provided as part of the jahia2wp codebase for historical reasons. (These themes are obsolescent, as obviously further development focuses on `wp-theme-2018`) |
| `wp-content/index.php`<br/>`wp-content/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate`<br/> and more (basically all files except the ones mentioned above)  | Extracted from the Docker image by `make checkout` | These files or plug-ins are required by WordPress, and one can even edit them, but the development kit doesn't help with pushing the changes upstream. (In fact, doing `make checkout` again will revert the edits.)<br/> üí° <b>There might be some plug-ins (even VPSI-authored plugins) in that state</b> ‚Äî See below |

üí° Depending on which branch of jahia2wp is checked out, there might be some plug-ins that exist in the Docker image, but not in `volumes/wp/jahia2wp/data/wp/wp-content/plugins`. If you type `make checkout` after changing branches in jahia2wp, the Makefile extracts the "orphan" plugins from the image, but (obviously) doesn't symlink them back into jahia2wp. These are not really source code ‚Äî That is, you could edit these files, but you won't be able to push the changes upstream, and the next `make checkout` will revert the changes.
